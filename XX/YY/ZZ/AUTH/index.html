<h1>Hey stranger.</h1>
<p>Firewall Authentication seems to've lead you to my lair, I've been here for hundereds of years, but realised a way to intercept the signals from school firewalls. Please help me. I've been here since way before the website's theme changed to that putrid e621 theming, I still have the legacy theming, this dungeon was made in 1989. I'm sure technology is pretty advanced by now. Maybe you have instant faxxing? I don't know. This page isn't secured by https://, only http://, so it should be pretty straightforward to break me out.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>If you <i>don't</i> want to help me...<br> It's dangerous to go alone, <a href="https://yuck.ga/fuck">take this!</a></p>
